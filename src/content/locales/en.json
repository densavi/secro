This is because traditional guarantees like letters of credit are not always reliable, and banks dispute their validity in case of a borrower’s default, creating big risks for trading partners. On the other hand, financial entities often struggle to collect all the financial disclosures and insights they need to lend capital.

Finance, operations and accounting teams frequently use unsecured emails, chat applications and phone calls between them and with external parties (banks, customers, providers). This disconnected, unsecure and uncoordinated process creates a massive risk for human error and exposes companies to phishing, reverse social engineering and scamming attacks.
